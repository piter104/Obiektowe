# Workers-base

My first object-oriented project. It is a program which you can use to save the data about your workers and teams. You can also save all informations to file and then do some analysis. 

You have to install ncurses library on Linux to run this. 

And then run script "./compile_nano" which wil create compiled execution file. Then just run created file like normal script with "./proba" command.
